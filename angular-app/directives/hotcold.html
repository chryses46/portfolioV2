    <h1>Hot or Cold Application</h1>
    <p>This page was a JavaScript challenge. It requests the user to input a number. If the number is close to an internally- generated secret number, it tells the user its guess is hot, or not. Many aspects of JavaScript were used in this project, built on the jQuery library. </p>
