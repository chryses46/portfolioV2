    <h1>My WordPress Site</h1>
    <p>This site was designed to show you what can be accomplished with WordPress. I have thrown together a basic site with a responsive theme. All of the back-end was completed by me in order to get the site operational. The WordPress site allows for addition of blog posts, media and comments by Authors and Editors whom wish to post to the page.</p>
