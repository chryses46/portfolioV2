<section class="about-me">
  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <br/>
  <p>I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a passion for challenge. Currently, I work for <a href="http://www.ddb.com" target="_blank">DDB Worldwide</a> as an Application Engineer. My primary focus is management of proprietary and third party applications that integrate with Active Directory, management of internal websites and site content, and administration of various back-end resources that control both.</p>
  <h3>Family, Friends and Fun</h3>
  <p>I don't always work! Spending my time off with my wife and 8 month old son is important to me. Going out to movies, theme parks or simply enjoying the day are some favorite family activities. My wife, Abigail, and I love video games, movies, telelvision and comic books. We're the regular nerdy couple with a tiny nerdy baby.</h2>
  <h3>Skill for the Web, Passion for the Stage</h3>
  <p>While I love working on beautiful, custom web sites, I love acting even more! I have been involved with theatre my whole life and could not imagine a world where I couldn't act. I've been in plays all around Dallas at theatres such as the <a href="www.pocketsandwich.com" title="Pocket Sandwhich Theatre">Pocket Sandwich Theatre</a>, <a href="http://www.brickroadtheatre.org/" title="Brick Road Theatre">Brick Road Theatre</a>, <a href="http://www.artcentretheatre.com/" title="Plano Arts Center Theatre">Plano Arts Center Theatre</a> and many more! If you're looking for good theatre in Dallas, any of these venues are a great start!</p>
