            <h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
            <p class="bodytext">I'm a Front End Web Developer with a passion for challenge. Currently, I work for a company called <a href="http://www.iuzeit.com">iuzeit</a>. iuzeit focuses on delivering product reviews from consumer, expert and friend's perspective, all aggregated into one site. </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="bodytext">It's very important to me to be happy. I want to be able to learn a variety of web and application languages in order to better myself in the field. I find it very interesting to learn new things, especially if I get to be creative with it. </p>

            <h2>Favorite hobbies</h2>
            <br/>
            <p class="bodytext">Too many. I have a passion for theatre and am constantly on stage or trying to get there. After that, television, movies and comics!</p>
            <br/>
            <h2>Dream job</h2>
            <br/>
            <p class="bodytext">To be on stage or in front of a camera for the rest of my life. Not literally. That's just ridiculous. Just when I'm awake, mostly.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2 class="interesting1">Experience</h2>
            <br/>
            <p class="bodytext">I've been in IT for over 10 years. I started working in Geek Squad while finishing up high school. I moved up through the years and have primarily been working with MSPs delivering customer support at the server administrator level. I now work every day to excel and grow my skills as a Front End Web Developer.</p>
            <br/>
            <h2 class="interesting1">Favorite TV Show</h2>
            <br/>
            <p class="bodytext">The Walking Dead. Nothing beats this intense, roller coaster ride of a television show!</p>
            <br/>
            <h2 class="interesting1">Favorite Book</h2>
            <br/>
            <p class="bodytext">The Walking Dead Graphic Novel series and The Walking Dead books. That's a lot of Walking Dead! I've also very much enjoyed writings by George R.R. Martin and J.R.R Tolkien.</p>
