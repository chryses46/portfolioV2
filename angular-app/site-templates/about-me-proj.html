            <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
            <p class="bodytext">I'm a Front-End Web Developer with a passion for challenge. Currently, I work for <a href="http://www.ddb.com" target=”_blank”>DDB Worldwide</a> as an Application Engineer. My primary focus is management of proprietary and third party applications that integrate with Active Directory, management of internal websites and site content and administration of various back-end resources that control both. </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="bodytext">It's very important to me to be happy. Finding new ways to challenge myself is a passion for me. Figuring out a different way to do the same thing is something that excites me.  I feel I have finally found a job that I love and cannot wait to see where it goes.</p>
