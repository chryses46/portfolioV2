  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>I'm a Front-End Web Developer with a passion for challenge. Currently, I work for <a href="http://www.ddb.com" target=”_blank”>DDB Worldwide</a> as an Application Engineer. My primary focus is management of proprietary and third party applications that integrate with Active Directory, management of internal websites and site content and administration of various back-end resources that control both.</p>
  <p>It's very important to me to be happy. Finding new ways to challenge myself is a passion for me. Figuring out a different way to do the same thing is something that excites me.</p>
  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>I've worked in IT for over 10 years. I started working in Geek Squad while finishing up high school. Moving up through the years, I've worked in Windows Server (Exchange, Active Directory, IIS) support with various managed service providers, assisting thousands of clients and users. My skillset includes HTML5, CSS3, SCSS (with Sassy pre-processor), Regular Expressions, AngularJS and jQuery JavaScrpit languages as well as Python and PowerShell for scripting. I now work every day to grow my knowledge in all aspects of my job. Recently I’ve been scripting with PowerShell, increasing my Angular JS knowledge and growing my overall Web Dev experience.</p>
  <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>I live with my wife and soon-to-be baby boy in Dallas, Texas. We have lived in many areas in and around Dallas, but the city is our favorite. There are amazing sights and sounds in most any part of the city to enjoy any time of day!</p>
