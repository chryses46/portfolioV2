    <h1>iuzeit Inc.</h1>
    <p>At my previous employer, I worked primarily on mobile re-design and development. I was instrumental in evaluating the current state of mobile-friendliness, and solve problems that were faced with the current design. I also spearheaded testing of dev code, as well as managed back-end Linux systems for iuzeit.</p>

    <h1>Amelia | Artist</h1>
    <p>I created this website for a Model client. We worked together to find the look she wanted and make it come alive. Since initially configuring this site, the domain has expired. I have migrated the site content into my portfolio to keep the site alive until she decides to purchase the domain again. </p>

    <h1>My WordPress Site</h1>
    <p>This site was designed to show you what can be accomplished with WordPress. I have thrown together a basic site with a responsive theme. The WordPress site allows for addition of blog posts, media and comments by Authors and Editors whom wish to post to the page.</p>
