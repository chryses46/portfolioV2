    <h1>iuzeit Inc.</h1>
    <p>At my previous employer, I worked primarily on mobile re-design and development. I was instrumental in evaluating the current state of mobile-friendliness, and solve problems that were faced with the current design. I also spearheaded testing of dev code, as well as managed back-end Linux systems for iuzeit.</p>

    <h1>Amelia | Artist</h1>
    <p>I recently created this website for a Model/ Actor client. I've implemented AngularJS, jQuery, Bootstrap and Sassy SCSS for the creation of the site. I set up the domain and host for this client, and use Git to initiate code updates via Linux SSH. Since initially configuring this site, the domain has expired. I have migrated the site content into my portfolio. </p>

    <h1>Hot or Cold Application</h1>
    <p>This page was a JavaScript challenge. It requests the user to input a number. If the number is close to an internally- generated secret number, it tells the user its guess is hot or cold. Many aspects of JavaScript were used in this project, built on the jQuery library. </p>

    <h1>My WordPress Site</h1>
    <p>This site was designed to show you what can be accomplished with WordPress. I have thrown together a basic site with a responsive theme.
